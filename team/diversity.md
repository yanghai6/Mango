# Diversity

Diversity is a proactive process in which we are all striving to work towards a more fair and equal community.

# Team Background

## Expertise

Max, our backend and infrastructure engineer from Vietnam, is experienced in pipeline building and production engineering, with extensive infrastructure and DevOps experience. As a highly adaptive person with honed public speaking and communications skills and previous experience in project management, he is also an assertive team leader and open-minded project manager for our team.

Also coming from Southeast Asia, our Singaporean market researcher and quality assurance engineer Mehak, who has led a startup simulation competition team, could bring us valuable experience in both the technical side and the business side. Her passion for innovating solutions leads us to new ideas and different perspectives.

Then, our full-stack developer, Steven, provides invaluable machine learning and AI proficiency as well as a critical eye for UI design to the team. As a Canadian, he is familiar with the Canadian cultural background and could bring us deeper insights into the local market.

Finally, our data scientist, Lily, specializing in data analysis and data engineering, is able to help the team solve problems in a data-driven way. Her ability to remain calm and productive under pressure could also help the team to endure unexpected situations.

## Lacking Expertise

Although the expertise of the team members lies in different technical fields, we are still lacking in some non-technical areas. Firstly, our topic domain is marketing science in the banking industry, but the team does not have previous experience or professional knowledge in this field. Thus our familiarity with our target market in Canada is limited. However, the international background of our team members could bring us a wider horizon for the global market.

Additionally, since all of our backgrounds are mainly in tech, we often find ourselves ill-equipped on the business side of things. As we are familiar with being “spoon-fed” with spec-ed out tasks and just simply do what we do best, implement. But having a dedicated time/course to hone these skills through CSC454 is definitely informative for us to train our soft skills.

While all of us are fluent in some part of the pipeline, we all find ourselves not being familiar with what other members can do. And being able to teach each other what we are lacking is an amazing opportunity.

## Subject Matter Experts

Due to the lack of expertise and background mentioned previously, it is significantly necessary for us to consult some subject matter experts during our market research and product development process. As for the banking industry, our industry partners from RBC are definitely rather helpful in filling our gap in banking. They will guide us to investigate the existing problem and provide us insights into customers’ needs in this industry. Furthermore, we are also open to consulting with experts from consulting institutions as well as university professors during our market research to address our lack of familiarity with the Canadian market.

Additionally, Mario, Julian and our RBC guests would be great subject matter experts to the skills we lack in business and software design. As stated in the previous question, since we mostly come from a tech background, our knowledge of how tech and business mesh together is still lacking. Having these resources in close reach is an incredibly valuable asset.

## Unconscious Bias

As many of the team members grew up in traditional Asian communities in Asia, we did not grow up in an entirely multicultural environment. Which means that our exposure to non-Asian people are mostly through Hollywood movies, and they usually carry heavy stereotypes in its content. These stereotypes are then infused to our mindset subconsciously, for example, we prefer to work with our fellow Asians because they are “usually smarter” and can bring more to the table. This unconscious bias is usually solved through time and experience. The more we are exposed to how one’s ability is completely unrelated to their ethnicity, the more this unconscious bias is removed.

## Diversity

As a start-up, our team size limits our diversity in multiple perspectives. Firstly, Canadian society is a mosaic of different backgrounds and cultures, but as all team members are from Asia, our cultural background is not as diverse as the demographics of the Canadian market, which might cause some cultural blindspots for our company, which might lead to blindspots on our target market.

Also, as university students, all of us are from the same age group, which means we lack the perspectives from a lot of other age groups that might also be target customers. As such, we do find it difficult to relate and develop solutions for the older generation which requires a different mindset of assistance. Fortunately, the key customer group of our product is Gen Z, who is also in the same customer groups as us, so we can at least capture the needs of our target segment.

Since we are all straight and cisgendered, it is hard for us to understand the severity of the struggles that LGBTQ+ people face. There may be areas that we could design that could better incorporate their needs or make them feel more comfortable. Additionally, due to the similarities of our backgrounds, there are a few other things we lack diversity in. For example, it will be difficult for us to represent potential customers with various educational levels or can we fully capture the perspectives of people with accessibility needs.

While it is clear to the team of our shortcomings with diversity, not having a personal relation with some of these aspects would engage us to be more proactive and inclusive in the development process. And with our glaring blind spots in mind, we are actively opening up all of our discussion to make sure that, while our targeted users are satisfied, everyone else would also feel that their needs are accommodated.

We are trying to build a product that will be useful for all people in the younger generation. By being exposed to the views and lifestyles of other diverse groups, we can better cater to their needs and, and at the same time, learn more about the world, both locally and globally.
