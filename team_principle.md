# Team Principles

_This is a growing document, any team-wide decision will be recorded here as the term progresses._

## **Communication**

- Team members will mainly communicate using a private slack channel: #mango.
- The purpose of this channel will be to confirm meetings, handle assignment questions and remind people to complete tasks.
- It will be the responsibility of the person asking the question to tag the people they are asking specifically.
- General questions can be posed to the group at large.
- While not strictly necessary, it will be seen as good etiquette to acknowledge important questions and answers by using thumbs up/down reactions to these messages.
- We expect everyone to check the group at least once a day (Monday to Friday). If there is a reason you cannot check the group for longer than 1 day, you are expected to inform the team so we know not to expect a response.
- Our primary goal with these expectations for communications is to promote a positive, cohesive, blameless culture within our group.
- Using Slack to communicate. Make sure to have notifications on. Everyone must also periodically check Slack for any new messages from the channel #mango
- Only tag people when really neccessary

## **Meetings**

- Monday + Friday are Zoom meetings. Standup update on weds.
- We will hold regular meetings for our team members. Specifically on Mondays and Fridays at 8PM Toronto Time.
- We will also require a self-reporting standup on every Wednesdays to keep the team up-to-date on the progress.
- Members are responsible for attending the team meetings â€“ if they are not able to make it, they must let the other attendees know as soon as possible.
- They must then make a plan to compensate for their absence. This could involve having someone present replace their role in the meeting or deliver an update on their behalf, and would also involves catching up on meeting contents to understand what new tasks they have.

## **Ticketing Tasks**

- Use Github's Project to manage tickets.
- Tickets will be created in realtime, and with sufficient information for anyone in the team to be able to pick up at anytime and finish in a timely manner.
- The team leader must be informed of all new tickets as they will also be taking on the PM role.

## **Work**

- Always communicate when there's something that's not clear so that we can all discuss as a group.
- If someone is blocked, everyone must drop and help unblock. Also report blocks as soon as possible.
- We are all there to support each other on the work involved for this course.
- We will try our best to delegate work evenly during our team meetings. This delegated work will be recorded on github issues.
- If something comes up, or the work is proving to be more time consuming and difficult than anticipated, then members are expected to let the team know. They will be able to help out.
- Team members are expected to also complete work with a resonable amount of time for the other members to review and discuss (can use pull requests and tags in issue comments to coordinate this). This means that last minute submissions of work are not ideal, since it is difficult to do this.

## **Other issues**

- We cannot foresee every kind of issue that might arise; however, the team is committed to coming up with a plan to overcome roadblocks of any kind through shared communication on how to handle the issue.
